# Pixel-wise-Lung-Segmentation-using-FC-DenseNet
Project for the course ML in Medical Imaging.

The project makes use of 103 layer FC-DenseNet trained from scratch on Lung images from Montgomery Lung Dataset. We perform the following tasks:
1. Data Augmentation: to improve #of images to 3x.
2. Model training and Hyperparameter tuning.
3. Use of a custom loss function to solve for poorly segmented diseased lungs.
